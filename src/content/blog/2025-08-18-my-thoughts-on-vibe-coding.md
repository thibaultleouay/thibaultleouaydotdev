I have been coding professionally for 10 years, and I'm not using AI to generate full parts of my apps.

I use AI as a smart IntelliSense; it's auto-complete. But I don't generate more than one line of code.

I don't like to have full functions or parts of code generated by AI. Most of the time, the code is harder to read and understand, and it's instant legacy code


Please don't vibe code your apps 🙏
