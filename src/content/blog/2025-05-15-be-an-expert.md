Last week [Max](https://mxkaske.dev) and I were talking with [Andreas Lehr](https://andreas-lehr.com/) about the state of synthetic monitoring. He told us itâ€™s better to be the expert in one thing instead of doing many things mildly.

It hit us hard when we started building [OpenStatus](https://www.openstatus.dev). We looked at our competitors, and they were doing a lot of things. We thought we would need to match most of their features to compete with them.

We wanted to build:

- an alert engine
- an incident management
- ...


It took us around 18 months to realize these teams had raised millions of dollars while we were bootstrapping. They can try a lot of things while we have to be smarter.

Our core product was synthetic monitoring and we should be the expert of synthetic monitoring instead of trying to do everything badly.

If you are building a SaaS, you should focus on one solving one problem before trying to expand your product.
